| Nov 12  | 11:40-11:55 | Completed the progam except for the last 2 bits which are currently sitll mismatched. I believe this is due to the java compiler respresenting everything in bytes rather than bits, so when the bits aren't a multiple of 8 (12502) then it adds padded bits that are just extra 0s on the end and because of this, the last character is mismatched. |
