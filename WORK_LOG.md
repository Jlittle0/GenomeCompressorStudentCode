I believe this is due to the java compiler respresenting everything in bytes rather than bits, so when the bits aren't a multiple of 8 (12502) then it adds padded bits that are just extra 0s on the end and because of this, the last character is mismatched. |
| Nov 13  | 4:00-4:30pm | Spent some more time working on the problemset, attempted a number of things to try to track the original/expected amount of bits from the output but was unable to because the compressing and expanding methods don't really interact with each other or occur in order so it just wouldn't let me count from one method and share it with the other through a global variable. Decided to just hardcode it for now since I know the expected value but not good :( |
